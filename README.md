## Deep-Segregation of Plastic (DSP): Segregation of Plastic and Non-Plastic using Deep learning

### About DSP
The aim of the project is to develop an engine which uses modern artificial intelligence approach, deep learning and computer vision to automatically classify the waste into plastic or non-plastic. This is just a proof-of-concept model. We have evaluate the performance of deep learning approaches such as CNN and CapsNet on both the publically avilable and real-time data sets.
